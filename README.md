## üîç How It Works

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see how the prediction works</b></summary>

1. **Data Collection**: The system uses historical agricultural price data combined with weather parameters.

2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical features are encoded.

3. **Feature Engineering**: The system extracts useful features from date columns and creates seasonal indicators.

4. **Model Training**: A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the processed data.

5. **Prediction**: For new inputs, the model predicts the crop price based on the provided features.

6. **Market Adjustment**: Predictions are adjusted based on current market trends and seasonal patterns.

7. **Forecast Generation**: The system generates a 7-day forecast using the base prediction and trend factors.
